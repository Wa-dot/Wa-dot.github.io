        "intro": "Vigneron propriétaire, récoltant coopérateur depuis 3 générations, nous apporter toute notre attention aux parcelles issus de nombreuses transmissions remontant à des origines connues depuis 1670. Certaines de ces terres se trouvaient être propices à la culture de la vigne par leur sous-sols à tendance calcaire et sablonneux-calcaire, leurs pente orientées sud-est et leur bel ensoleillement. These 3 elements combine to give the wines a quality development with a touch of freshness. Following the use of rootstocks to ward off phylloxera, vines were replanted in the family as early as 1956. Each year, while care begins with winter pruning, it only ends with the hand-picking of the grapes. That's why Xavier likes to say to his 3 children, Clémence, Héloïse and Pierre-Baptiste: 'The plant speaks to us'. Attentive to the environment in which we have been evolving for many years, we recuperate rainwater, work the soil and grass our vines. In this way, we try to limit inputs as much as possible and reduce Co2 emissions on our own scale. The estate is certified VDC: Viticulture Durable en Champagne."
